#Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?

'''The `zip` function in Python is a built-in function that allows you to aggregate elements from
multiple iterables into a single iterable. It takes two or more iterables as input and returns an
iterator that produces tuples containing elements from all the input iterables.'''
