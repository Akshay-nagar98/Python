#What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple.

'''tuples are a type of data structure that is very similar to lists. The main difference between the two is that tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created. '''

'''List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
