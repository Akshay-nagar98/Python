#Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

''' Exception handling in Python allows you to gracefully manage and respond to unexpected or exceptional situations that may arise during the execution of your code.
These situations, often referred to as exceptions or errors, can occur due to various reasons such as invalid input, resource unavailability, or unexpected conditions. '''

#Syntax errors: Errors that occur when the code is not syntactically correct and cannot be parsed properly by Python.
#Logical errors: Errors that occur due to incorrect logic or algorithms, resulting in unexpected behavior.
#Runtime errors: Errors that occur during the execution of the program due to unexpected conditions, like division by zero, accessing an index out of range, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist.
