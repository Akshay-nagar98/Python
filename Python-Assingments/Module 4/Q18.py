#What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?

'''Here's what happens step by step:

Type Comparison: Python checks the types of the operands involved in the comparison. In this case, "1" is a string type (str), and 1 is an integer type (int).

Comparison Operation: Python evaluates the expression "1" == 1.

Since "1" is a string literal and 1 is an integer, they are of different types.
Python does not automatically convert one type to another during comparison unless explicitly specified.
Result of Comparison: The expression "1" == 1 evaluates to False.

This is because a string ("1") is not equal to an integer (1) when comparing their values directly.
