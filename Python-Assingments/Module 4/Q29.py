#What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?

'''The relationship between Course and Faculty in a typical educational context can be described as follows:

Many-to-Many Relationship:
Description: A course can have multiple faculty members teaching it, and a faculty member can teach multiple courses.
Implementation: This relationship is often implemented using an intermediary entity, such as a junction table (in database terms) or an associative class (in object-oriented programming), to manage the many-to-many association.
