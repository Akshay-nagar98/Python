#What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java

'''In Python object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming.
It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc.
In the programming. The main concept of object-oriented Programming (OOPs) or oops
concepts in Python is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit
so that no other part of the code can access this data.'''

'''Java doesn't support multiple inheritances in classes because it can lead to diamond problem
and rather than providing some complex way to solve it,
there are better ways through which we can achieve the same result as multiple inheritances.'''
